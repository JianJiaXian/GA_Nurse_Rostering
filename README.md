#  Genetic Algorithm for Nurse Rostering & Scheduling

This project applies a genetic algorithm to solve the **NP-hard nurse rostering problem**, with the goal of minimizing patient wait times and medical staff overtime, while respecting legal and preference constraints.

##  Problem Description

Operating room scheduling differs from general ward scheduling due to:
- Uncertainty in patient operations
- Required prioritization of surgeries
- Staffing and rest regulations

Hospitals often rely on manual experience for shift planning, which may lead to:
- Long patient wait times
- Excessive staff overtime
- Suboptimal satisfaction and performance

This project uses **genetic algorithms** to provide objective, optimized schedules in reasonable time.

##  Dependencies

```bash
pip install deap seaborn
```

##  Genetic Representation

### Binary Encoding

Each shift is encoded as a 3-bit vector:

| Shift | Binary Code | Time           |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Early | [1, 0, 0]   | 07:00â€“15:00    |
| Afternoon | [0, 1, 0] | 15:00â€“23:00 |
| Night | [0, 0, 1]   | 23:00â€“07:00    |
| Off   | [0, 0, 0]   | â€”              |

##  Problem Constraints

###  Hard Constraints
1. A nurse can only work one shift per day.
2. No consecutive shifts allowed (e.g., afternoon + night).
3. Each nurse must have at least **2 days off** per week.
4. **Minimum staff** required per shift:
   - Early: 2â€“4 nurses
   - Afternoon: 2â€“4 nurses
   - Night: 1â€“2 nurses

###  Soft Constraints
- Nurse schedule preferences

### Main Parameters

| Days | Population | Generations | Crossover | Mutation |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 31   | 300        | 500         | 0.9       | 0.1      |

### Operators

| Selection          | Crossover               | Mutation            |
|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Random             | Two-point               | FlipBit             |
| Roulette Wheel     | Uniform (0.3â€“0.7)       | Gaussian Mutation   |
| Fitness Best/Worst | PMX, Order Crossover    | Inversion Mutation  |

##  Running the Code

```bash
python rostering.py
```

##  Experimental Results

### Result Summary

| ID | Selection | Crossover | Mutation | Min Fitness | Mean Fitness |
|----|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| a  | Random    | Two-point | FlipBit  | 319.0       | 542.48       |
| f  | Fitness Best | Uniform(0.5) | FlipBit | **11.0** | **23.01**   |
| g  | Fitness Best | Uniform(0.7) | FlipBit | **8.0**  | **17.67**   |

> Best results were achieved using:  
> **Fitness Best Selection + Uniform Crossover (0.7) + FlipBit Mutation**

We export the final 31-day schedule to Excel for easy viewing by nurses.

##  Conclusion

- A binary genetic encoding was used to model the scheduling task.
- Domain-specific constraints and nurse preferences were embedded into the fitness function.
- The best-performing GA configuration significantly reduced scheduling conflicts and overtime.

##  Future Work

1. Extend to **multi-objective optimization**.
2. Improve handling of real-world dynamic events.
3. Tailor constraints for specific hospital policies.
